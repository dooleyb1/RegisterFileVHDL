# RegisterFileVHDL
Circuit design of a 16bit register file containing 8 registers written in VHDL. Operations available include register transfers and loading registers with 16 bit values.

Also contains **testbenches** for each respective component.

### Components 
*Register File
*Register(16bit))
*Decoder(3to8)
*Multiplexer(8to1)
*Multiplexer(2to1)

**Circuit Schematic (_Adjusted to 8 x 16bit Registers_)**:
