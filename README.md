# RegisterFileVHDL
Circuit design of a 16bit register file containing 8 registers written in VHDL. Operations available include register transfers and loading registers with 16 bit values.

Also contains **testbenches** for each respective component.

### Components 
* Register File
* Register(16bit)
* Decoder(3to8)
* Multiplexer(8to1)
* Multiplexer(2to1)
